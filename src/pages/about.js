            <p>I am a Video Game Programmer. 
                Over the last three years, I have worked on multiple projects for VR, Mobile and PC. 
                One of the games I enjoyed working on is an audio game for PC that was built to be played by both sighted and visually impaired individuals. 
                My strongest skills include Gameplay Programming, Audio Programming, User Interface and Level Design. 
                I enjoy participating in Game Jams â€“ I participated in 23 weekly jams between Feb and Aug 2020. 
                I am currently looking to offer my skills and gain experience working in an established game studio anywhere in the word. In future, I would like to start my own studio. </p>
