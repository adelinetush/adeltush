# Details 

It took two weeks to upload this game. Everything seemed to drag. Motivation was low. But the game is here now. It’s not great, but things are looking up.

We are learning something new every week and that’s good. 

We still need to learn to spend more time on the games, to take the deadlines seriously, and to try and produce the best possible games in the available time, as opposed to making the simplest game on the last day of the week.
