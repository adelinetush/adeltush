### ELIZA

![Screenshot](./eliza.jpg)

**Game Title:** Eliza 

# Summary 

This game is about this girl, Evelyn. She was a programmer who worked for a startup to build Eliza, a program that was meant to listen to people, that is, cheap therapy. In the game, she quits the job after the death of a colleague because what she's creating doesn't make sense to her anymore.  

# Spoilers 

The game takes place in a period 3 years after Evelyn quits Eliza. She's working at one of the counseling stations for Eliza as a proxy. All through the game, you play as Eliza, you meet with her patients at the counseling facility and listen to them, you also interact with the people in Evelyn's life - Nora who Eliza worked with on Eliza, her ex bosses Rainer and the other guy, and Rae her current boss. Throughout this time Eliza is confused about what to do with her life. In the end, you make that choice. I chose to leave the city and everything behind.

# What I liked about this game

Evelyn was 31 when she quit Eliza. She wanted to work on projects but the days just went by and she just lay in bed. She would lie in bed even if she was awake. Then one day she woke up and she was 34. As she says, she slept into her mid-thirties. 

I really liked this game because I related with Evelyn on so many levels. But above all, one of my biggest fears is sleeping into my 30's. Not literally, but just not doing enough before I'm 30.
